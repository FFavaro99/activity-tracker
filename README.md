# activity-tracker
A simple js, html and css activity tracker.


Current functionalities are: 
  - Add activities with specified names and target times (whis is then stored in an array called activityQueue);
  - Start a countdown that begins from the specified time for the first task;
  - Pause the countdown anytime;
  - Pausing the countdown will make a count up begin, to keep track of how long of a break you are taking;
  - At the end of an activity the current activity will switch to the next one and the countdown will automatically pause;



What I have left to do:
  - Make the interface responsive, as the current UI is just a mock to test functionality;
  - Add an on-screen to-do list;
  - Add the possibility to remove an activity from the list;
  - Add the possibility to skip an activity halfway through;
  
Additional functionality will be added as I keep developing and feel like something is missing. For everyone reading this readme, feel free to make constructive criticism as this is the very first tiny JavaScript project I'm working on to hone my skills. Many will follow!
